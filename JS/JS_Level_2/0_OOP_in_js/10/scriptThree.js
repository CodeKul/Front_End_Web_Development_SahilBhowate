//Object Prototypes
//Extending the design of the existing parent class into a child class for code-reusability.
//Example
//:-- Telephone system working on coins.
//:-- Wending Machine

//Consider every object belongs to some other parent object.
//That is it is inherting some properties from that particular parent object.
//And that parent object is known as "prototype" in javascript.

console.log(Object.prototype);

//What is prototype chaining ?
