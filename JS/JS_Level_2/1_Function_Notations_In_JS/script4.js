//arrow function
// ES6 introduced a new and shorter way of declaring an anonymous function, which is known as Arrow Functions. In an Arrow function, everything remains the same, except here we don’t need the function keyword also. Here, we define the function by a single parenthesis and then ‘=>’ followed by the function body.

let getData = () => {
  console.log("The name is Tushar");
};
