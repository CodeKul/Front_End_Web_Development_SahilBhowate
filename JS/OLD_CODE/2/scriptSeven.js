//There are 2 kinds of types in js
//1) Primitive Types
//Strings
//Numbers
//Booleans Values
//Bigint
//Undefined and null
//Symbol

// 2) Object Types
// Array
// Object literal

// Difference between primitive and non-primitive ?
// The primitive types are immutable -- that is they cannot be modified.
// The non-primitive types are mutable

//Primitive values are saved as "stored by value way".
//Non-Primitive values are saved as "stored by reference way".
