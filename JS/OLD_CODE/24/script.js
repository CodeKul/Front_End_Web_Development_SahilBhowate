//What is the meaning of "throwing the error" ?
//It means that we need to throw an exception to signal that some kind of error occured.
//We need to handle that exception by catching it.

//To handle the error situations in the program we are using try/catch/finally statement.

// try{

// Block of code to try

// }catch(error){

// Block of code to handle errors

// Block of code which is executed when the try block throws any exception.

// }
// finally{

// Block of code to be executed without any concern of try/catch result.

// Even if the try block does not throw any exception ; still the code inside
// finally block is going to be executed.

// Even if the try block throws any exception ; still the code inside
// finally block is going to be executed.

// }
