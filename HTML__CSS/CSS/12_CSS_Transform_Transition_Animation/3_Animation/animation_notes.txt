For more explicit control over changes on the page, CSS
offers keyframe animation.

A keyframe refers to a specific point in an animation. You define some number of
keyframes, and the browser fills in, or interpolates, all the frames in between

A transition is conceptually similar to a keyframe animation: You define the first frame
(starting point) and the last (ending point), and the browser computes all the inter-
mediate values so the element can transition smoothly between them. 

With keyframe animation, however, you’re not limited to defining only two points. You can define as
many as you like. The browser fills in the values from one to the next to the next, until
it reaches the final keyframe, producing a series of seamless transitions.

What are keyframes in CSS ?
Animations in CSS contain two parts:
[1] The @keyframes at-rule, which defines an animation,  
[2] The animation's set of properties, which applies that animation to an element.

The animation's set of properties are as follows :

[1] animation-name ( over-and-back )—Indicates the name of the animation as
defined by the @keyframes rule.

[2] animation-duration ( 1.5s )—Indicates how long the animation lasts; in this
case, 1.5 seconds.

[3] animation-timing-function ( linear )—Indicates a timing function describ-
ing how the animation accelerates and/or decelerates. This can be a Bézier
curve or a keyword value, like a transition timing function ( ease-in , ease-out ,
and so on).

[4] animation-iteration-count ( 3 )—Indicates the number of times the anima-
tion repeats. If omitted, the initial value of 1 is used.
