aspect-ratio
The aspect-ratio CSS property allows you to define the desired width-to-height ratio of an element's box. This means that even if the parent container or viewport size changes, the browser will adjust the element's dimensions to maintain the specified width-to-height ratio. The specified aspect ratio is used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.

At least one of the box's sizes needs to be automatic in order for aspect-ratio to have any effect. If neither the width nor height is an automatic size, then the provided aspect ratio has no effect on the box's preferred sizes.
